# Projects
The aim of machine learning is to ensure that models are well-generalized, and eliminating underfitting and overfitting. 
The following projects aim to ensure that models achieve the optimal generalization, thereby achieving accurate prediction of unseen data.
To achieve this generalization measures have been applied to improve the model.

## 1. [Heart Disease Classification](#)
This project predicts whether a patient has heart disease or not, depending on certain health factors of the patient. 
**Task**: Classification
**Algorithms**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes.
**Results:** Generalization improved by 3% after applying Hyperparameter Tuning.

## 2. [Loan Approval Classification](#)
This project predicts whether a loan applicant qualifies for a loan or not, depending on the characteristics of the applicant.
**Task:** Classification
**Algorithms:** LSTMs
**Results:**
