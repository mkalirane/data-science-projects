My data science projects are arranged into different folders as follows:

## **[Classification](https://github.com/mkalirane/projects/tree/main/Classification)**

#### 1. Heart Disease Classification
 This project predicts whether a patient has heart disease or not, depending on certain health factors of the patient. 
- **Objective**: Heart disease is a very pervasive disease. Thus we want early detection and accurate detection.
- **Task**: Classification
- **Algorithms**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.

#### 2. Loan Approval Classification
This project predicts whether a loan applicant qualifies for a loan or not, depending on the characteristics of the applicant.
- **Objective:** Financial institutions want to ensure that customers are accurately classified, to avoid losses. Thus we need a generalized model.
- **Task:** Classification
- **Algorithms:** LSTM

## **[Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)](https://github.com/mkalirane/projects/tree/main/CNN)**

#### 3. Car Image Classification
This project classifies cars into luxury market or mass-market classes, depending on the images of the car.
- **Objective:** Classifying cars into luxury or mass-market classes are helpful for car sale sites because it
- **Task:** Image Classification
- **Algorithms:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  
## **[Linear Regression](https://github.com/mkalirane/projects/tree/main/Linear%20Regression)**

#### 4. Medical Costs Prediction
This project predicts the medical costs of the patient, depending on the characteristics of the patients, such as age, BMI, gender, etc.
- **Objective:** Understanding the factors that influence medical insurance costs can aid in financial planning and policy-making decisions.
- **Task:** Regression
- **Algorithms:** Linear Regression

## **[Logistic Regression](https://github.com/mkalirane/projects/tree/main/Logistic%20Regression)**

#### 5. Heart Disease Classification
 This project predicts whether a patient has heart disease or not, depending on certain health factors of the patient. 
- **Objective**: Heart disease is a very pervasive disease. Thus we want early detection and accurate detection.
- **Task**: Classification
- **Algorithms**: Logistic Regression.

## **[RNN (LSTM)](https://github.com/mkalirane/projects/tree/main/LSTM)**

#### 6. Starbucks Reviews Classification
This project predicts whether a Starbucks customer review belongs to which star rating (1 to 5) , depending on the characteristics of the text.
- **Objective:** Useful for ratings websites
- **Task:** Classification
- **Algorithms:** RNN (LSTM)

## **[Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://github.com/mkalirane/projects/tree/main/Linear%20Regression)**

#### 7. Spam Email Classification
This project predicts whether an email is spam or ham , depending on the characteristics of the text in the email.
- **Objective:** Useful for helping accurately categorize emails
- **Task:** Classification
- **Algorithms:** KNN
