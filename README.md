My data science projects are arranged into different folders as follows:

## **Classification**

#### 1. [Heart Disease Classification](#)
 This project predicts whether a patient has heart disease or not, depending on certain health factors of the patient. 
- **Objective**: Heart disease is a very pervasive disease. Thus we want early detection and accurate detection.
- **Task**: Classification
- **Algorithms**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.
- **Results:** Generalization improved by 3% after applying Hyperparameter Tuning.

## 2. [Loan Approval Classification](#)
This project predicts whether a loan applicant qualifies for a loan or not, depending on the characteristics of the applicant.
- **Objective:** Financial institutions want to ensure that customers are accurately classified, to avoid losses. Thus we need a generalized model.
- **Task:** Classification
- **Algorithms:** LSTMs
- **Results:**

## **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**

#### 2. [Car Image Classification](#)
This project classifies cars into luxury market or mass-market classes, depending on the images of the car.
- **Objective:** Classifying cars into luxury or mass-market classes are helpful for car sale sites because it
- **Task:** Image Classification
- **Algorithms:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- **Results:**

## ** Linear Regression**

#### 3. [Medical Costs Prediction](#)
This project predicts the medical costs of the patient, depending on the characteristics of the patients, such as age, BMI, gender, etc.
- **Objective:** Understanding the factors that influence medical insurance costs can aid in financial planning and policy-making decisions.
- **Task:** Regression
- **Algorithms:** Linear Regression
- **Results:**

## **Logistic Regression**

#### 4. [Heart Disease Classification](#)
 This project predicts whether a patient has heart disease or not, depending on certain health factors of the patient. 
- **Objective**: Heart disease is a very pervasive disease. Thus we want early detection and accurate detection.
- **Task**: Classification
- **Algorithms**: Logistic Regression.
- **Results:** Generalization improved by 3% after applying Hyperparameter Tuning.

## **RNN (LSTM)**

#### 5. [Starbucks Reviews Classification](#)
This project predicts whether a Starbucks customer review belongs to which star rating (1 to 5) , depending on the characteristics of the text.
- **Objective:** Useful for ratings websites
- **Task:** Classification
- **Algorithms:** RNN (LSTM)
- **Results:**

## **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

#### 6. [Spam Email Classification](#)
This project predicts whether an email is spam or ham , depending on the characteristics of the text in the email.
- **Objective:** Useful for helping accurately categorize emails
- **Task:** Classification
- **Algorithms:** KNN
- **Results:**
